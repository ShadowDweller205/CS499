## About Me

I am a collage student in my final year for my Bachelor of Computer Science. I have spent 5 years working towards this goal at night and on weekends while holding full time positions at various companies. Below are just a few samples of my work and my capabilities.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ShadowDweller205/CS499/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
