## About Me

I am a college student in my final year for my Bachelor of Computer Science. I have spent 5 years working towards this goal at night and on weekends while holding full time positions at various companies. Below are just a few samples of my work and my capabilities.

```markdown
   This artifact is an OpenGL program created in C++. We took 
a collection of boxes and turn it into something else with 
three basic shapes. I have taken one box and changed it into 
a table that is a shape of a plane, and a lantern which was a 
lot of shapes of cubes and pyramids. This was created on 
2021-03-11. I selected this artifact because I had fun making 
this object. The specific component of the artifact that I 
wanted to show case is my ability to see the creation of an 
object in a set of points. I was able to see the points to 
make the triangles to make a particular object. The first image 
is the lantern and table in my yard. The second image is the 
recreation of that object in this programming environment. 
The scene is set at night to give the illustration of the 
different lighting.
